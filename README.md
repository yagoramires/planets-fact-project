#  <a href="https://planets-yago.vercel.app/">  Planets Facts Site </a>


<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-CONCLU%C3%8DDO-green" align="center">


## Brief
Your challenge is to build out this 8-page planets fact site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local data.json file for the planets. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate .html files.
